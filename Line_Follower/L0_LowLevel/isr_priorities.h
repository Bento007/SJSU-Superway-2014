 * Interrupt Priorities
 *  0 - Highest
 * 31 - Lowest
 *
 * Interrupts used in this project must NOT use higher priority than IP_SYSCALL, so
 * if IP_SYSCALL is set to 5, then interrupt priority must be higher number than 5
 * in order to set it to lower priority.
 *
 * FromISR() FreeRTOS API cannot be called from interrupts that have higher priority
 * than IP_SYSCALL, which means that:
 *  - YOUR ISR must have numerically equal to or HIGHER value than IP_SYSCALL
 *
 * The interrupts that use higher priority than IP_SYSCALL MUST NOT USE FREERTOS API.
 * These higher priority interrupts (even higher than FreeRTOS kernel) can be used
 * to specify "super" priority above everything else in the system.
